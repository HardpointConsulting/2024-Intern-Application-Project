Excited about LLM internship at Hardpoint Consulting (International Hackathon 2024). Strong academic background and passion for AI/LLMs/web dev make me eager to contribute and develop my skills in any area.

Experienced using LLMs with Python frameworks. Hackathon projects led to a deep understanding of LLM training, which I'm eager to apply professionally.

Ready to tackle any task to gain experience and contribute to team success. Hardpoint Consulting's vision inspires me.

Short-term goal: Diverse experiences in 1 year. Mid-term goal (3 years): Integrate AI/LLMs into daily life. Long-term goal (5 years): Lead a passionate AI team, developing advancements that rival tech giants.

Thank you for considering me. Eager to discuss how my skills align with your program.

Sincerely,

Vishnu Sudheer
