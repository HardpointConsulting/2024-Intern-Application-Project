I am writing to express my interest in the LLM internship opportunity at Hardpoint Consulting, as mentioned in regards to the International Hackathon 2024. With a strong academic background and a passion for AI, LLM and Web Development, I am eager to contribute to your esteemed organization and further develop my skills in any area required.

I have been honing my knowledge in using LLM integrated with Python frameworks. Through my projects and hackathons, I have developed a keen understanding of LLM training, which I am eager to apply in a professional setting.

During my internship, I am keen to immerse myself in any task assigned, with the goal of gaining practical experience and contributing to the success of your team. I am particularly drawn to the vision of this organization and am excited about this opportunity.

In the short term, my one-year goal is to gain as much novel experiences as possible. Over the next three years, I aim to venture into integrating AI and LLMs into day-to-day uses of people. Looking further ahead, my five-year goal is to lead a team of passionate developers to conquer every corner of AI and to develop versions competing even today's tech giants.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Hardpoint Consulting and look forward to the possibility of discussing how my skills and experience align with your internship program.

Sincerely,

Rohit C.
